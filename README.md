# 💧 GeWaGen V2.0: ROTATING SURFACE SHELL THERMAL MASS SYSTEM

**An Open-Source Design for High-Performance Atmospheric Water Generation (AWG)**

* **Version:** V2.0 (High-Efficiency, Low-Power Prototype Concept)
* **License:** MIT Licensed
* **Core Principle:** To actively manage the temperature of a stationary thermal mass using a dynamic, rotating outer shell, significantly lowering the condensation temperature with minimum energy input.

## 1. V2.0 INNOVATION: FIXED MASS / ROTATING SHELL

GeWaGen V2.0 radically simplifies the thermal management challenge. Unlike concepts that require rotating the entire heavy thermal mass, this design focuses power on the **lightweight outer shell**, dramatically reducing operational complexity and cost.

### Key Design Features:

* **Fixed Thermal Mass:** The inner condensation pipes and the surrounding **wet earth/sand mass** remain stationary. This mass acts as the stable thermal buffer where cold is stored.
* **Dynamic Outer Shell (The Innovation):** The outermost cylindrical casing is composed of two longitudinal halves: one highly **Reflective (Mylar)** and one highly **Emissive (Radiative Cooling Paint)**.
* **180° Low-Power Rotation:** Only this lightweight shell rotates **180 degrees** twice daily (at dawn and dusk), minimizing the required motor strength and energy consumption.

## 2. HOW IT WORKS: PRECISION THERMAL MANAGEMENT

The rotating shell ensures the fixed thermal mass temperature is actively managed to maintain optimum condensation levels (below $25^\circ \text{C}$) year-round.

| Cycle | Surface Facing the Sun | Mechanism and Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Daytime (Protection)** | **Reflective** surface (Mylar) faces the sun. | **Blocks over 90%** of solar heat, preventing heat ingress into the fixed mass. Preserves the stored coolness effectively. |
| **Nighttime (Cooling)** | **Emissive** surface faces the cold night sky. | **Actively sheds stored heat** via radiative cooling, pulling the temperature of the thermal mass below the ambient and below the earth's natural thermal baseline. |

This dynamic insulation ensures the condensation pipe temperature remains consistently below the dew point, maximizing water yield.

## 3. PERFORMANCE AND LOGISTICAL ADVANTAGES

This simplified V2.0 design retains the high theoretical yield while drastically improving practical implementation and scalability.

| Criterion | V1.0 (Deep Buried Pipe) | V2.0 (Rotating Shell) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Installation Cost** | High (Requires deep excavation) | **Very Low (Surface installation)** |
| **Condensation Rate** (Theoretical) | $\approx 0.18 \text{ L/m}^2/\text{hr}$ | **$\approx 0.43 \text{ L/m}^2/\text{hr}$** |
| **Power for Rotation** | Very High (Rotating entire mass) | **Very Low (Rotating only lightweight shell)** |
| **Complexity** | High (Sealing underground) | Low (Easily serviceable surface mount) |

## 4. NEXT STEPS AND CALL FOR COLLABORATION

The next phase for V2.0 is to design a simple, robust, **low-power rotation mechanism** capable of smoothly moving the outer shell (e.g., solar-powered timer motor, rack-and-pinion system).

> **Join Us:** We are seeking collaborators in **Mechanical Engineering** and **Low-Power Robotics** to prototype and refine this high-efficiency, open-source water solution.
